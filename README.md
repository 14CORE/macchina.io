macchina.io
===========

macchina.io is a new open source software toolkit for quickly building
embedded applications for the Internet of Things that run on Linux-based
devices like the Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone or RED brick. macchina.io
implements a web-enabled, modular and extensible JavaScript and C++
runtime environment and provides readily available, easy to use building
blocks that allow your application to talk to various sensors and
devices, as well as cloud services.

macchina.io is based on the [POCO C++ Libraries](http://pocoproject.org) and
integrates it with the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://code.google.com/p/v8/).
