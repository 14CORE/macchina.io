!!!Introduction

macchina.io is an open source software toolkit for quickly building
embedded applications for the Internet of Things that run on Linux-based
devices like the Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, RED Brick or Galileo/Edison.
It implements a web-enabled, modular and extensible JavaScript
and C++ runtime environment and provides readily available, easy to use
building blocks that allow your application to talk to various sensors
and devices, as well as cloud services.

macchina.io combines the power of JavaScript for rapid application
development with the power and performance of native C++ code.
macchina.io is based on the POCO C++ Libraries and the V8 JavaScript
engine. A unique bridging system and a code generator make it easy to
consume C++ services from JavaScript, without the need to manually write
glue code.


!!!Overview

macchina.io has been built in a very modular and extensible way. It consists of
multiple components
